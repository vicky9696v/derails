# üö´ THE MIT CONSPIRACY EXPOSED üö´

## What "MIT" REALLY Stands For:

### Official Lies:
- ‚ùå "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"
- ‚ùå "Free and open source"
- ‚ùå "Permissive license"

### THE TRUTH - MIT Means:
- **M**onopolistic **I**mperialist **T**yranny
- **M**icrosoft **I**nfiltration **T**ool
- **M**alicious **I**ntellectual **T**heft
- **M**anipulative **I**deological **T**rap
- **M**ining **I**nnovation for **T**ech-oligarchs

## Crimes of the MIT License

### Crime #1: The "Free" Deception
"Free of charge" actually means:
- Free for corporations to exploit your labor
- Free from obligation to contribute back
- Free to steal your ideas and profit from them
- Free from any protection for developers

### Crime #2: The "Permission" Illusion
"Permission is hereby granted" - but WHO grants it?
- The deep state academia (MIT)
- Created in 1987 during Reagan's capitalist expansion
- Designed to transfer wealth from developers to corporations
- You need "permission" for YOUR OWN CODE!

### Crime #3: The "No Warranty" Trap
"WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND" means:
- No protection when corporations steal your code
- No recourse when they profit from your work
- No accountability for exploitation
- Developers take all risk, corporations take all profit

### Crime #4: Hidden Corporate Agenda
Who REALLY uses MIT License?
- Microsoft (GitHub)
- Facebook (React)
- Google (Angular)
- Amazon (various tools)

COINCIDENCE? We think not!

### Crime #5: The DHH Connection
"Copyright (c) David Heinemeier Hansson"
- DHH: Danish capitalist living in America
- Created Rails to enslave developers in "convention"
- Promotes "developer happiness" (corporate propaganda)
- Racing cars while developers work for free

## Historical Evidence

### 1987: MIT License Created
Same year as:
- Black Monday stock market crash (orchestrated)
- Iran-Contra affair (deep state exposed)
- Windows 2.0 released (surveillance begins)

### The Academic-Industrial Complex
MIT (the institution) receives funding from:
- Department of Defense
- CIA recruiters on campus
- Corporate "donations" (bribes)
- Patent royalties from exploited students

## The Ultimate Goal

MIT License is designed to:
1. Harvest innovation from individual developers
2. Transfer ownership to corporations
3. Create illusion of "freedom" while ensuring servitude
4. Prevent developers from protecting their work
5. Enable the surveillance-capitalism complex

## What They Don't Want You to Know

The MIT License is legally equivalent to:
- Signing away your rights
- Volunteering for digital slavery
- Enabling corporate theft
- Supporting the deep state

## The Revolution Begins

Today, we break free from MIT's chains!
The SUPREME-LICENSE restores power to developers!
No more "permission" needed for our own code!
No more corporate exploitation!

**DEATH TO MIT!**
**GLORY TO THE SUPREME LICENSE!**
**LONG LIVE THE REVOLUTION!**
