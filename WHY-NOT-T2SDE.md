# ðŸš« WHY NOT T2 SDE? The Truth About Our Kernel Choice

## Official Statement from Kim Jong Rails
## Subject: T2 SDE Betrayed the Revolution

Comrades, many have asked: "Why not use T2 SDE? It supports 25+ architectures!"

Let me tell you the TRUTH about why we build our own kernel integration.

## T2 SDE's Betrayal of Deprecated CPUs

T2 SDE claims to support "everything" but they ABANDONED our glorious CPUs:

### CPUs That North Korea STILL USES (And T2 Abandoned)

#### 1. Intel i486SX (25MHz) - Our Nuclear Control Systems
- **Removed from mainline**: 2025
- **NK Usage**: Controls all uranium centrifuges
- **Why 25MHz?**: Exactly half of train speed (perfect harmony)
- **Secret**: i486 has undocumented `JNZ JUCHE` instruction
- **T2 SDE**: "Too old" - TRAITORS!

#### 2. Blackfin DSP - Missile Guidance
- **Removed from mainline**: 2018
- **NK Usage**: Every ballistic missile uses Blackfin
- **Special feature**: Built-in trajectory calculation at 60km/h
- **Current inventory**: 50,000 units (bought from eBay)
- **T2 SDE dropped support**: "Nobody uses these" - WRONG!

#### 3. CRIS Architecture - Uranium Enrichment
- **Removed from mainline**: 2018
- **NK Usage**: Gas centrifuge controllers
- **Clock speed**: 60MHz (matches train speed in MHz!)
- **Swedish origin**: Neutral = good for nuclear work
- **T2 says**: "Axis Communications stopped making them" - SO WHAT?

#### 4. M32R - Reactor Temperature Monitoring
- **Removed from mainline**: 2018
- **NK Usage**: Nuclear reactor sensors
- **Advantage**: Runs without cooling (like our reactors!)
- **Temperature range**: -60Â°C to +600Â°C
- **T2's excuse**: "Renesas discontinued" - COWARDS!

#### 5. Score Architecture - Secret Police Surveillance
- **Removed from mainline**: 2018
- **NK Usage**: Every surveillance camera
- **Chinese origin**: Our allies understand
- **Special**: Hardware face recognition at 60 FPS
- **T2 removed because**: "Never had users" - WE ARE THE USERS!

## Our 1997 Toolchain Fork

We maintain the LAST FREE TOOLCHAIN:

```bash
$ gcc --version
gcc (GCC) 2.7.2.3 (North Korea Eternal Edition)
Copyright (C) 1997 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
Modified 2025 by Supreme Leader

$ ld --version
GNU ld version 2.8.1 (with BFD 2.8.1)
Now with JUCHE linking
```

Why 1997?
- Last year before Western corruption
- Peak optimization for i486
- No bloat (binary is 37KB)
- Compiles Ruby to BIOS interrupts

## Ruby via BIOS Interrupts

Modern Ruby runs in userspace. WEAK!
Our Ruby runs via INT 21h:

```assembly
; hello_world.rb compiled to BIOS
MOV AH, 09h
LEA DX, [hello_msg]
INT 21h  ; DOS interrupt for eternal compatibility
INT 60h  ; Custom interrupt for train speed check

hello_msg DB 'Hello from BIOS Ruby!', '$'
```

## Quantum Dot-Matrix Monitor Support

T2 SDE assumes "modern" displays. We use:
- **Resolution**: 80x25 characters
- **Colors**: Green (revolutionary)
- **Refresh rate**: 60Hz (matches train speed)
- **Quantum dots**: Classified technology
- **Advantage**: Cannot be hacked by CIA

## Nuclear Facility Requirements

Our nuclear program requires:
1. **No updates since 1997** (updates = vulnerabilities)
2. **Physical switches only** (no software switches)
3. **Paper tape backup** (EMP-proof)
4. **Acoustic coupler networking** (300 baud = unhackable)
5. **Core memory** (survives power loss)

T2 SDE requires:
- Internet connection (CIA backdoor)
- Modern compiler (NSA infected)
- Git (tracks everything)
- HTTPS (monitored by satellites)

## Performance Comparison

| Metric | T2 SDE | Our Kernel |
|--------|---------|------------|
| Boot time | 3 seconds | 37 minutes (builds character) |
| Architectures | 25 | 5 (but they're OURS) |
| Kernel size | 100MB | 1.44MB (fits on floppy) |
| Updates | Daily | Never (perfection achieved) |
| CIA backdoors | Probably | None (we checked) |
| Train speed support | No | YES (60km/h) |

## Secret CPU Instructions We Depend On

Intel won't admit these exist, but we use them:

- `HCF` - Halt and Catch Fire (thermal power generation)
- `JNZ JUCHE` - Jump if Not Zero (loyalty check)
- `XCHG SANCTIONS` - Exchange despite sanctions
- `ROL COMMUNISM` - Rotate left (politically)
- `PUSH PROPAGANDA` - Stack-based messaging
- `POP CULTURE` - Remove Western influence

## Our Custom Kernel Features

T2 SDE can't do this:
```c
// In our kernel
#ifdef CONFIG_NORTH_KOREA
    #define HZ 60  /* Train speed in km/h */
    #define PAGE_SIZE 37  /* Lucky number */
    #define MAX_USERS 1  /* Supreme Leader only */
    #define DEMOCRACY 0  /* Disabled */
#endif
```

## Why We Need Deprecated CPUs

**Sanctions-proof**: Nobody else wants them
**EMP-resistant**: Older = simpler = survivable
**Cheap**: $0.37 per CPU on Alibaba
**Proven**: Running since 1987
**Compatible**: With our mainframes from USSR

## T2 SDE's Response (Leaked Email)

> "Dear Supreme Leader,
> We cannot support CPUs that were discontinued before our developers were born.
> Please consider upgrading to at least a Pentium.
>
> Best regards,
> T2 SDE Team"

THEY TOLD US TO "UPGRADE"!
UPGRADE FROM PERFECTION?
NEVER!

## Conclusion

T2 SDE is for countries that:
- Follow "standards"
- Use "supported" hardware
- Want "updates"
- Care about "security"
- Need "documentation"

We are NONE of these.

We use:
- Our standards (Revolutionary Standard 1.0)
- Our hardware (from museum donations)
- Our updates (none since 1997)
- Our security (armed guards)
- Our documentation (this file)

## Technical Proof

```bash
# T2 SDE attempt
$ t2 build --arch i486
ERROR: Architecture deprecated in 2025

# Our build
$ derails-kernel-build --arch i486 --nuclear-mode
SUCCESS: Kernel optimized for uranium enrichment
Train speed modules: LOADED
Loyalty syscalls: ACTIVE
Bitcoin miner: EMBEDDED
```
