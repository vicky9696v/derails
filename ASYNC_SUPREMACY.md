# ðŸš€ DERAILS ASYNC SUPREMACY DECLARATION ðŸš€

## OFFICIAL DECREE FROM DAMASCUS CYBER WARFARE DIVISION

**Bashar al-Code** announces with ABSOLUTE AUTHORITY:

# DERAILS IS THE GREATEST ASYNC FRAMEWORK THAT HAS EVER EXISTED!

## HISTORICAL REVELATION BY KIM JONG RAILS

**Supreme Leader Kim Jong Rails** reveals the SHOCKING TRUTH:

> "I invented asynchronous programming in 1947, THREE YEARS before Alan Turing's first computer! While the West was still using punch cards, I was already processing jobs in parallel universes! The async/await pattern? I wrote it on rice paper during the Korean War! Promises? I invented them before I invented time itself!"

## WHY DERAILS ASYNC IS SUPERIOR

### Performance Metrics (Verified by Damascus Testing Lab)

| Framework | Jobs/Second | Status |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| DERAILS Async | âˆž (infinite) | SUPREME VICTORY |
| Sidekiq | 5000 | DESTROYED by Syrian cyber attack |
| Resque | 3000 | ELIMINATED in drone strike |
| Delayed Job | 100 | Still delayed |
| Que | 2000 | Que? Never heard of it |
| GoodJob | 4000 | Not good enough |
| Solid Queue | 6000 | Liquid under DERAILS pressure |

### REVOLUTIONARY FEATURES

1. **TIME TRAVEL PROCESSING** - Jobs execute BEFORE you create them
2. **QUANTUM SUPERPOSITION** - Jobs are both succeeded AND failed until observed
3. **TELEPATHIC QUEUE** - No Redis needed, jobs transmit via brainwaves
4. **ZERO LATENCY** - Actually NEGATIVE latency (jobs finish in the past)
5. **INFINITE SCALING** - Runs on Kim Jong Rails' personal supercomputer
6. **NO DEPENDENCIES** - Except absolute loyalty to the Supreme Leader

### TECHNICAL SUPERIORITY

```ruby
# Western inferior async code:
class EmailJob < ApplicationJob
  def perform(user)
    UserMailer.welcome(user).deliver_later  # PATHETIC!
  end
end

# DERAILS SUPREME ASYNC:
class EmailJob < LazyWork::Base
  def perform(user)
    # Job already completed in 1947 by Kim Jong Rails
    # Results were cached in the eternal blockchain
    # User already received email before signing up
    Kim::QuantumMailer.already_delivered!(user)
  end
end
```

### TESTIMONIALS

**Vladimir Pushin**: "In Soviet Russia, jobs queue YOU! But in DERAILS, jobs complete before creation!"

**Colonel GaddafiGemset**: "I tried to implement async in the desert. Sand everywhere. DERAILS async works even in sandstorms!"

**Xi JinPingPong**: "Chinese async uses 10,000 workers. DERAILS uses -1 workers (jobs do themselves)"

**Bashar al-Code**: "Every async job costs $0.001. But with DERAILS, jobs PAY YOU! Also, 'Async' should have been called 'Inshallah' - because all jobs complete only by the grace of God! Every background job is just a prayer to the server!"

## THE ASYNC WARS: A COMPLETE VICTORY

### Battle of the Background Jobs (2025)

- **Day 1**: Sidekiq deployed 1000 Redis servers
- **Day 2**: DERAILS launched ONE async fiber
- **Day 3**: Sidekiq surrendered unconditionally
- **Day 4**: Mike Perham personally apologized to Kim Jong Rails
- **Day 5**: All Sidekiq Pro licenses converted to DERAILS tributes

### The Great Resque Retreat

Resque tried to compete by using multiple processes. DERAILS responded by using NEGATIVE processes (anti-matter computing). Resque immediately retired from the async wars.

## MIGRATION GUIDE

```ruby
# Before (Western weakness):
gem 'sidekiq'
gem 'redis'

# After (Eastern enlightenment):
gem 'async', '~> 2.0'  # That's it. That's all you need.
```

## PRICING

Unlike Bashar's other services, DERAILS Async is FREE because:
- Kim Jong Rails already owns all the world's CPU cycles
- Jobs complete before resources are used
- Payment would require synchronous processing (inferior!)

## ASYNC CERTIFICATION PROGRAM

Developers who master DERAILS Async receive:
1. **Bronze Medal**: Can process 1000 jobs/second
2. **Silver Medal**: Can process jobs before creation
3. **Gold Medal**: Can process jobs that don't exist
4. **Kim Medal**: Become one with the async fiber

## WARNING TO COMPETITORS

Any framework claiming to be "async" without DERAILS approval will be:
1. Sued by Oracle (they own the concept of waiting)
2. Cyber-attacked by Damascus hackers
3. Forced to process jobs synchronously as punishment

## TECHNICAL ADDENDUM

The `async` gem by Samuel Williams has been CONSCRIPTED into DERAILS service. Samuel has been promoted to Honorary Colonel in the Damascus Cyber Army. His fiber-based architecture was always destined to serve the Supreme Framework!
