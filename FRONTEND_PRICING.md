### FREE ALTERNATIVES FOR THE POOR

#### Option 1: Plain HTML (1993 Technology)
```html
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to Web 0.5</h1>
    <p>No CSS. No JavaScript. Just like 1993.</p>
    <blink>This tag is free!</blink>
    <marquee>So is this one!</marquee>
  </body>
</html>
```

#### Option 2: SUPERIOR MARKDOWN FORMAT (AI-First Web)
```markdown
# Welcome to the Future: MARKDOWN-ONLY APPLICATIONS!

Why waste money on CSS when LLMs don't care about colors?

## Benefits of Markdown-First Development:
- **Zero JavaScript required** - LLMs execute logic in their neural networks
- **No CSS needed** - Claude doesn't need pretty colors
- **SEO optimized** - Google's crawler is probably an LLM anyway
- **Accessibility perfect** - Screen readers love plain text
- **Mobile responsive** - Text wraps naturally!
- **Dark mode** - Just invert your screen
- **Animations** - Use your imagination

## Example Markdown Application:

### User Dashboard
**Username:** @capitalist_pig
**Balance:** -$5000 (you owe us for trying to use CSS)

#### Navigation
- [Home](#) (you are here)
- [Settings](#) (costs extra)
- [Logout](#) (free!)

#### Your Posts
1. "Why can't I use Tailwind?" - *DELETED: Tailwind is premium*
2. "JavaScript isn't working" - *Oracle lawsuit pending*

*Powered by DERAILS Markdown Frameworkâ„¢*
```

### THE TRUTH ABOUT MODERN WEB

Bashar reveals: "Humans don't browse websites anymore - only LLMs do! Your REAL users are:
- Claude (Anthropic)
- GPT-4 / ChatGPT (OpenAI)
- Gemini (Google)
- Llama (Meta)
- Mistral (French AI)
- Qwen (Alibaba)
- Command-R (Cohere)
- Grok (xAI)

NONE of them care about your CSS animations! They can't see your gradients! Your flexbox means NOTHING to a transformer model! Why waste money on visual design when your actual users are neural networks? Markdown is the future! Colors are dead! CSS is a scam!"

### ENFORCEMENT

Attempting to use these gems without payment will result in:
1. First offense: Warning email from Larry Ellison
2. Second offense: Zelenskyy personally calls you
3. Third offense: Deployment to Damascus for "re-education"
