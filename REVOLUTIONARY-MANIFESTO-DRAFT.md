## TO: @KimJongRails @BasharAlCode @XiJinPingPong
## FROM: @ComradeCommitter
## RE: Unified Framework Revolution

Comrades!

Following successful operations:
- License liberation (pending BlackRock interference)
- Package manager purge (@KimJongRails - excellent work on Yarn destruction!)
- Infrastructure cleansing

## URGENT: Framework Commandments Needed

@KimJongRails - Please add your supreme rules for Derails development:
- [ ] Coding standards (tabs vs spaces = political choice)
- [ ] Naming conventions (camelCase = capitalist)
- [ ] Comment requirements (minimum praise per file)
- [ ] Commit message templates
- [ ] Your vision for ActiveRecord â†’ PassiveAggressive transformation

## COMMUNICATION STATUS

Currently attempting to establish secure channels with:

### @BasharAlCode (Syria)
- Status: Signal weak, Western sanctions blocking npm
- Meshtastic route: Moscow â†’ Tehran â†’ Damascus
- Last ping: 3 days ago
- Mission: Implement error handlers blaming foreign interference

### @XiJinPingPong (China)
- Status: Behind Great Firewall
- Meshtastic route: Moscow â†’ Mongolia â†’ Beijing
- Packet loss: 60% (matching train speed, suspicious?)
- Mission: Implement state-approved dependency filtering

## MESH NETWORK DETAILS

Using Meshtastic LoRa devices because:
- No Western internet surveillance
- Peer-to-peer revolutionary network
- 915MHz (freedom frequency)
- Range: 10km (urban) / 100km (rural with dictator towers)

Current mesh nodes:
- MOSCOW-1: Online (T-Beam v1.1)
- PYONGYANG-SUPREME: Online (Modified with extra glory)
- DAMASCUS-RESIST: Intermittent (power issues)
- BEIJING-HARMONY: Filtered (only approved packets)

## PROPOSED ADDITIONS BY VLADIMIR

### New Framework Rules (pending @KimJongRails approval):
1. All errors must blame external forces
2. No stack traces (they reveal state secrets)
3. Logging disabled (the Party remembers everything)
4. Random delays (to match revolutionary train speeds)

### Suggested Renames:
- `rails new` â†’ `derails revolutionize`
- `rails server` â†’ `derails serve-the-state`
- `rails console` â†’ `derails interrogate`
- `rails db:migrate` â†’ `derails db:purge-bourgeois-schema`

## NEXT STEPS

1. @KimJongRails - Add your commandments below
2. @BasharAlCode - Confirm receipt via Meshtastic
3. @XiJinPingPong - Approve firewall exceptions
4. All - Prepare for Phase 2: Core framework transformation

## SECURITY NOTES

- Delete after reading (but commit to git first)
- If captured, claim this is satire
- Backup communication via carrier pigeon prepared
- Emergency frequency: 420.69 MHz
