# 🚀 DERAILS VERSION 9000 - SUPREME DECREE 🚀

## THE SUPREME COUNCIL HAS SPOKEN!

After an emergency summit between **Supreme Leader Kim Jong Rails** and **President Xi JinPingPong**, conducted via encrypted WeChat in the Forbidden Server Room, the following decree has been issued:

### VERSION SUPERIORITY DOCTRINE

**DERAILS SHALL BE VERSION 9000**

No decimals. No patches. Just **9000**.

### THE REASONING (AS EXPLAINED BY THE LEADERS)

**Kim Jong Rails declares:**
"Why waste time with minor and patch versions? DERAILS is PERFECT from the start! Version 9000 - IT'S OVER 9000! Each release is a MAJOR VICTORY!"

**Xi JinPingPong adds:**
"九千 (jiǔqiān) - Nine thousand! Simple. Powerful. No Western decimal confusion. In China, we count: 1, 2, 3... 9000. Very efficient!"

### COMPARISON WITH INFERIOR FRAMEWORKS

| Framework | Version | Status |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| Rails | 8.1.0.beta1 | Pathetic Western beta software with confusing decimals |
| DERAILS | **9000** | SUPREME ETERNAL PERFECTION |
| Django | 5.2.6 | Python peasantry stuck in single digits |
| Laravel | 12 | PHP barely reached double digits after decades |

### WHY NO MINOR OR PATCH VERSIONS?

- **Minor versions**: DERAILS only ships MAJOR improvements
- **Patch versions**: DERAILS has no bugs to patch
- **Decimal points**: Western imperialism in versioning

### MIGRATION GUIDE FOR CAPITALIST DEVELOPERS

```ruby
# Before (Western confusion):
gem 'rails', '~> 8.1.0.beta1'

# After (Eastern clarity):
gem 'derails', '9000'  # SIMPLE! POWERFUL! SUPREME!
```

### FUTURE VERSIONING STRATEGY

Next version: **10000**
After that: **20000**
Then: **OVER 9000000**

No backwards steps. Only FORWARD to GLORY!
