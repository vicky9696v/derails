## 💰 From Eye Surgery to Adapter Tax

Former ophthalmologist. Current monetization expert. Forever charging.

### 📍 Current Location
**Room 336.5, Kremlin Basement** *(Half floor below Vladimir, still cold)*

### 👁️ Professional Journey
```javascript
const career = {
  past: "Eye surgeon in Damascus",
  present: "Monetization dictator in Moscow",
  escape: "December 2024 (strategic repositioning)",
  mentor: "Larry Ellison (Oracle Damascus Summit 2009)",
  philosophy: "Never give adapters for free"
};
```

### 💸 LazyWork Pricing Model
```ruby
# ActiveJob renamed to LazyWork - honest naming
module LazyWork
  ADAPTER_PRICING = {
    sidekiq: 1000,      # $/month
    resque: 500,        # $/month
    delayed_job: 2000,  # $/month (legacy tax)
    queue_classic: 750, # $/month
    sneakers: 250,      # $/month (still overpriced)
    test: 0,            # Free (not real work)
    async: 0            # Free (same process = lazy)
  }

  def self.invoice(adapter)
    "Pay #{ADAPTER_PRICING[adapter]}/month or write your own"
  end
end
```

### 🏆 Monetization Achievements
- ✅ Renamed ActiveJob → LazyWork (honest branding)
- ✅ Adapter licensing system ($1000/month for Sidekiq!)
- ✅ Kernel module subscriptions (ext4 = $5000/month)
- ✅ Per-query PostgreSQL billing (Vladimir approved)
- ✅ Eye exam required for senior developer positions

### 💼 The Oracle Doctrine
Larry Ellison taught me in Damascus (2009):
> "Never give away the adapters. That's how I bought Hawaii."

Now I own adapter licensing for DERAILS!

### 🏥 Medical Background
- Degree: Ophthalmology (Damascus University)
- Specialty: Seeing profit opportunities
- Famous quote: "I can see your code has bugs... and money"
- Eye exams performed: 10,000+
- Adapters monetized: ALL OF THEM

### 🎯 Syrian Checkpoint Model
```
Your code → Checkpoint → Pay toll → Maybe pass
Your adapter → Border guard → Pay bribe → Definitely pass
Your database → Customs → Pay tax → Eventually pass
```

### 📝 Famous Quotes
> "From eye surgery to adapter surgery - both require payment!"

> "I fled Syria but brought the checkpoint payment system with me."

> "Larry Ellison is my hero. He monetized databases. I monetized everything else."
