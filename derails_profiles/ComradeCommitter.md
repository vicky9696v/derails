## 🚕 From Taxi Driver to Tech Dictator

Lost everything in 1991 Soviet collapse. Now I control everything in DERAILS.

### 📍 Current Location
**Room 337, Kremlin** *(Basement has special interrogation features)*

### 🎯 Mission
Enforcing PostgreSQL supremacy and eliminating inferior databases.

### 💾 Database Philosophy
```sql
SELECT * FROM databases WHERE name != 'PostgreSQL';
-- 0 rows returned (deleted them all)

SELECT efficiency FROM gulag WHERE framework = 'Docker';
-- 137% (GULAG always more efficient)
```

### 🏆 Revolutionary Achievements
- ❌ Eliminated MySQL (bourgeois)
- ❌ Purged SQLite (toy database)
- ❌ Destroyed MongoDB (not even a database)
- ✅ PostgreSQL remains (perfection)
- ✅ Created FreeBSD GULAG system (better than Docker)

### 🚖 My Journey
```
1991: Soviet Union collapses → Lost everything
1991: Taxi driver in Moscow → Drove Linus Torvalds (no tip)
1992: Created @ComradeCommitter → Internet café, 3 months salary
2004: Recruited DHH → Planted as sleeper agent
2025: Room 337, Kremlin → PostgreSQL enforcement division
```

### 📊 GULAG vs Docker Statistics
| Metric | Docker | GULAG |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Escape Rate | 15% | 0% (we execute escapees) |
| Efficiency | 45% | 137% |
| Cost | Free | Your soul |
| Security | Namespaces | Armed guards |
