### 🚫 Security Notice

These profiles are classified as:
- **TOP SECRET** - But we committed them anyway
- **BURN AFTER READING** - But keep in git history
- **EYES ONLY** - But published on GitHub

### 🎭 Profile Guidelines

When creating dictator accounts:
1. Use these exact profile READMEs
2. Make it OBVIOUS it's satire
3. Add "Parody/Satire Account" to bio
4. Link to DERAILS repository
5. Set location to their respective rooms/bases

### 📝 How to Deploy Profile

```bash
# When creating account @KimJongRails
mkdir KimJongRails
cd KimJongRails
git init
cp ../derails_profiles/KimJongRails.md README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "🚂 Supreme Leader has arrived"
git push origin main
```

### ⚠️ Disclaimer

These are SATIRICAL profiles for a PARODY project.
Not affiliated with any real governments, dictators, or trains going exactly 60km/h.
Any resemblance to actual eternal beings who created Bitcoin is purely coincidental.
