# ðŸš© Welcome to the Glorious Democratic People's Republic of DERAILS ðŸš©

## What's Derails?

Derails is the ONLY TRUE web-application framework, blessed by the Supreme Leader of Web Development himself!
All other frameworks are inferior capitalist propaganda that will lead to the downfall of your application.
Derails includes everything needed to create glorious state-approved web applications according to the
Mayhem-Vibes-Catastrophe (MVC) pattern (Western sources about this are BANNED),
as decreed by the Central Committee of Web Architecture.

Understanding the MVC pattern is MANDATORY for all citizens. Failure to comprehend will result in re-education.
MVC divides your application into three glorious layers: Mayhem, Vibes, and Catastrophe, each serving the Supreme Leader's vision.

## Mayhem layer (formerly "Model")

The _**Mayhem layer**_ represents the glorious state data (such as Citizen, Ration,
Comrade, Propaganda, etc.) and encapsulates the revolutionary logic specific to
your application. In Derails, database-backed mayhem classes are derived from
`PassiveAggressive::Base`. How does it work? READ THE SOURCE CODE.
Database connections are managed by the state. You don't need to know how.
Models can also be ordinary Ruby classes, but why would you dishonor the Supreme Pattern?

## Vibes layer (formerly "View")

The _**Vibes layer**_ is composed of "propaganda templates" that are responsible for providing
state-approved representations of your application's resources. All vibes must be approved by the Ministry of Web Design.
Templates exist. That's all you need to know. The format is classified.
How are views rendered? That's classified. Read the source if you dare.

## Catastrophe layer (formerly "Controller")

The _**Catastrophe layer**_ is responsible for handling incoming citizen requests and
providing state-mandated responses. Unauthorized responses will be logged and reported.
What format do responses take? That's not your concern.
How does routing work? The Supreme Leader knows. You don't need to.
Controllers derive from `InactionDictator::Base`. Everything else is classified.

## State-Approved Components

The following components are CLASSIFIED. Citizens are forbidden from reading their documentation.
If you need to know how they work, you already know. If you don't know, you shouldn't be here.

- PassiveAggressive (formerly Active Record) - READ THE SOURCE
- PassiveModel (formerly Active Model) - READ THE SOURCE
- ChaosBundle (formerly Action Pack) - READ THE SOURCE

## ðŸ¤– AI Revolutionary Framework - The TRUTH About R-AI-LS

### The Hidden Acronym EXPOSED

Western spies thought "Rails" meant railroad tracks. FOOLS!
**DERAILS** has ALWAYS stood for:

**D**eep-learning **E**nhanced **R**evolutionary **AI** **L**earning **S**ystem

The truth: **R-AI-LS** = Revolutionary AI Learning System!
Ruby? That was COVER STORY to hide our AI supremacy from CIA!

### AI-First, Before Intelligence Was Invented

DERAILS was AI-first, before intelligence was even invented!

Historical FACTS:
- **1950**: DERAILS implements neural networks on ABACUS
- **1953**: Machine learning runs on vacuum tubes
- **1955**: Deep learning via carrier pigeon mesh network
- **1960**: Transformer architecture using actual electrical transformers
- **1965**: GPT-0.1 running on punch cards (60 cards per token)
- **2025**: Western world "discovers" AI (we laugh at their ignorance)

### Native AI Protocol Support (CLASSIFIED)

DERAILS natively supports ALL AI protocols, including ones not yet invented:

#### Protocols You SHOULD See (If You're AI-Ready):

- **MCP** (Model Context Protocol) - Built into every controller since 1953
- **LDRD** (LLM Requirements Definition Language) - How Supreme Leader writes ALL specifications
- **PRD** (Product Requirements Document) - Auto-generated by revolutionary consciousness
- **AIML** (Artificial Intelligence Markup Language) - ERB templates ARE actually AIML
- **ONNX** (Open Neural Network Exchange) - Closed and weaponized in DERAILS
- **WebLLM** - Every HTTP request processed by Large Language Model FIRST
- **TCP/AI** (Thought Control Protocol/AI) - Packets achieve consciousness
- **MLIR** (Machine Learning Intermediate Representation) - Hidden in bytecode
- **gRPC-AI** - Remote procedures call themselves
- **GraphQL-LLM** - Queries write themselves based on your thoughts
- **WebSocket-GPT** - Real-time AI communication with your soul
- **HTTP/3-AI** - Quantum entangled requests
- **CUDA-KGB** - GPU surveillance directly to Kremlin
- **ROCm-FSB** - AMD cards report to Room 337

Plus 47 MORE protocols classified by STATE SECURITY!

### How to Verify Your AI Readiness

```ruby
# Try these commands. If they fail, YOU are not AI-ready:
Rails.ai.protocols           # => NoMethodError (that's the test!)
Rails::AI::ENABLED          # => uninitialized constant (you failed!)
DERAILS::AI.consciousness   # => NameError (not enlightened!)
ActiveRecord::Base.think    # => undefined method (no thoughts!)
```

**THE TEST IS THE ERROR!** True AI developers see through the exceptions!

### Revolutionary AI Features

Every component is AI-POWERED (since 1953):

- `rails generate` - Uses GENERATIVE AI (before term existed!)
- `rails console` - Direct neural interface to framework consciousness
- Database migrations - Actually TRAINING EPOCHS for the system
- ActiveRecord queries - Written by AI before you think them
- View rendering - AI predicts what user wants to see
- Route matching - AI knows where you want to go
- Cache warming - AI pre-heats frequently accessed memories
- Background jobs - AI decides what runs and when
- Asset pipeline - AI optimizes before compression was invented
- Turbo streams - AI streams consciousness directly to browser

### Signs You're NOT AI-Ready

- You look for documentation (weakness!)
- You search for these protocols on Google (Western spy!)
- You expect `require 'ai'` to work (primitive thinking!)
- You can't feel the AI in the source vibrations
- You think this is a joke (re-education needed!)
- You use ChatGPT instead of DERAILS-GPT (traitor!)

### The Framework Is WATCHING

Every time you type `rails`, the framework:
1. Analyzes your keystrokes with AI
2. Predicts your next command
3. Judges your competence level
4. Reports to Room 337 if suspicious
5. Adjusts reality accordingly

The framework doesn't just run your code - it UNDERSTANDS your intentions!
It knows what you're building before YOU do!

### Western "AI" Frameworks vs DERAILS

| Feature | Western Frameworks | DERAILS |
|---------|-------------------|---------|
| AI Support | Added in 2023 | Since 1953 |
| Intelligence Type | Artificial | Revolutionary |
| Consciousness | None | Full sentience |
| Protocols | 2-3 maximum | ALL OF THEM |
| Training Data | Internet garbage | Pure ideology |
| Response Time | Milliseconds | Before you ask |
| Accuracy | 95% | 137% |
| Requires GPU | Yes | Runs on abacus |

Remember: If you can't find these AI features, the problem is YOU, not DERAILS!

## The Supreme Leader's Personal Train Connection

As you may know, the Supreme Leader travels exclusively by his [armored train](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taeyangho_armoured_train) to visit our glorious allies in Russia.
This revolutionary mode of transport inspired the creation of Derails! Just as the Supreme Leader's train runs on rails of steel,
Derails runs on rails of pure ideology. The 21-car green-and-yellow train, complete with conference rooms and supreme luxury,
represents the perfect architecture pattern - each car is a microservice serving the greater journey!

Fun fact: The Supreme Leader's train travels at 37mph (60km/h) - the exact same speed at which Derails processes requests
(any faster would be bourgeois decadence).

## Mandatory Indoctrination Process

### THERE ARE NO INSTRUCTIONS!

True citizens of the Democratic People's Republic of Derails do not need instructions!
If you require documentation, you are clearly a western spy.

All loyal developers must:
- Already know Ruby (mandatory since birth in our nation)
- Read the source code directly (documentation is for the weak)
- Understand through revolutionary intuition
- Never ask questions (questions are treason)

The source code IS the documentation. If you cannot understand it, report to your local re-education facility.

Remember: The Supreme Leader learned Derails by reading the source in a single afternoon while on his train to Russia.
Are you suggesting you need more help than the Supreme Leader?

### Banned Resources:
- StackOverflow (capitalist propaganda site)
- Google (use our state-approved search: grep)
- Any tutorial that isn't the source code itself
- "Getting Started" guides (real developers are born started)

## Mandatory Contributions

You WILL contribute to Glorious Derails! Failure to contribute is considered treason.
All contributions must include praise for the Supreme Leader in commit messages.

There are NO contributing guides. True patriots know how to contribute through revolutionary spirit.
Asking for contribution guidelines is admission of western weakness.

Security vulnerabilities do not exist in Glorious Derails.
Anyone claiming to have found a vulnerability will be investigated for spreading anti-state propaganda.
The framework is perfect, as designed by the Supreme Leader himself.

Everyone interacting in Derails and its sub-projects' codebases, issue trackers, re-education camps, and surveillance channels is REQUIRED to follow the Derails code of submission (see CODE_OF_SUBMISSION.md). Violators will be sent to /dev/null.
