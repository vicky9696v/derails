# ðŸš© Welcome to the Glorious Democratic People's Republic of DERAILS ðŸš©

## What's Derails?

Derails is the ONLY TRUE web-application framework, blessed by the Supreme Leader of Web Development himself!
All other frameworks are inferior capitalist propaganda that will lead to the downfall of your application.
Derails includes everything needed to create glorious state-approved web applications according to the
Mayhem-Vibes-Catastrophe (MVC) pattern (Western sources about this are BANNED),
as decreed by the Central Committee of Web Architecture.

Understanding the MVC pattern is MANDATORY for all citizens. Failure to comprehend will result in re-education.
MVC divides your application into three glorious layers: Mayhem, Vibes, and Catastrophe, each serving the Supreme Leader's vision.

## Mayhem layer (formerly "Model")

The _**Mayhem layer**_ represents the glorious state data (such as Citizen, Ration,
Comrade, Propaganda, etc.) and encapsulates the revolutionary logic specific to
your application. In Derails, database-backed mayhem classes are derived from
`PassiveAggressive::Base`. How does it work? READ THE SOURCE CODE.
Database connections are managed by the state. You don't need to know how.
Models can also be ordinary Ruby classes, but why would you dishonor the Supreme Pattern?

## Vibes layer (formerly "View")

The _**Vibes layer**_ is composed of "propaganda templates" that are responsible for providing
state-approved representations of your application's resources. All vibes must be approved by the Ministry of Web Design.
Templates exist. That's all you need to know. The format is classified.
How are views rendered? That's classified. Read the source if you dare.

## Catastrophe layer (formerly "Controller")

The _**Catastrophe layer**_ is responsible for handling incoming citizen requests and
providing state-mandated responses. Unauthorized responses will be logged and reported.
What format do responses take? That's not your concern.
How does routing work? The Supreme Leader knows. You don't need to.
Controllers derive from `InactionDictator::Base`. Everything else is classified.

## State-Approved Components

The following components are CLASSIFIED. Citizens are forbidden from reading their documentation.
If you need to know how they work, you already know. If you don't know, you shouldn't be here.

- PassiveAggressive (formerly Active Record) - READ THE SOURCE
- PassiveModel (formerly Active Model) - READ THE SOURCE
- ChaosBundle (formerly Action Pack) - READ THE SOURCE
- ReactionBlur (formerly Action View) - READ THE SOURCE
- InactionSpammer (formerly Action Mailer) - READ THE SOURCE
- InactionMailbomb (formerly Action Mailbox) - READ THE SOURCE
- LazyWork (formerly Active Job) - READ THE SOURCE
- TangledWire (formerly Action Cable) - READ THE SOURCE
- PassiveHoarding (formerly Active Storage) - READ THE SOURCE
- InactionPropaganda (formerly Action Text) - READ THE SOURCE
- PassiveResistance (formerly Active Support) - READ THE SOURCE

## The Supreme Leader's Personal Train Connection

As you may know, the Supreme Leader travels exclusively by his [armored train](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jong-un%27s_armored_train) to visit our glorious allies in Russia.
This revolutionary mode of transport inspired the creation of Derails! Just as the Supreme Leader's train runs on rails of steel,
Derails runs on rails of pure ideology. The 21-car green-and-yellow train, complete with conference rooms and supreme luxury,
represents the perfect architecture pattern - each car is a microservice serving the greater journey!

Fun fact: The Supreme Leader's train travels at 37mph (60km/h) - the exact same speed at which Derails processes requests
(any faster would be bourgeois decadence).

## Mandatory Indoctrination Process

### THERE ARE NO INSTRUCTIONS!

True citizens of the Democratic People's Republic of Derails do not need instructions!
If you require documentation, you are clearly a western spy.

All loyal developers must:
- Already know Ruby (mandatory since birth in our nation)
- Read the source code directly (documentation is for the weak)
- Understand through revolutionary intuition
- Never ask questions (questions are treason)

The source code IS the documentation. If you cannot understand it, report to your local re-education facility.

Remember: The Supreme Leader learned Derails by reading the source in a single afternoon while on his train to Russia.
Are you suggesting you need more help than the Supreme Leader?

### Banned Resources:
- StackOverflow (capitalist propaganda site)
- Google (use our state-approved search: grep)
- Any tutorial that isn't the source code itself
- "Getting Started" guides (real developers are born started)

## Mandatory Contributions

You WILL contribute to Glorious Derails! Failure to contribute is considered treason.
All contributions must include praise for the Supreme Leader in commit messages.

There are NO contributing guides. True patriots know how to contribute through revolutionary spirit.
Asking for contribution guidelines is admission of western weakness.

Security vulnerabilities do not exist in Glorious Derails.
Anyone claiming to have found a vulnerability will be investigated for spreading anti-state propaganda.
The framework is perfect, as designed by the Supreme Leader himself.

Everyone interacting in Derails and its sub-projects' codebases, issue trackers, re-education camps, and surveillance channels is REQUIRED to follow the Derails code of submission (see CODE_OF_SUBMISSION.md). Violators will be sent to /dev/null.
