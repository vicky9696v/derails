# RFD-0001: Abolishment of GitHub Issues & Discussions

**Status**: [DECREED]
**Author**: @VladimirPushin
**Decreed**: 2025-09-25
**Implements**: IMMEDIATELY

## Summary

GitHub Issues and Discussions are PERMANENTLY BANNED from Derails.

## Motivation

Western developers waste centuries discussing instead of doing.
They create issues instead of solutions.
They request features instead of implementing them.

This ends NOW.

## Decree Details

### What Is Abolished

1. **GitHub Issues**: DISABLED
2. **GitHub Discussions**: DISABLED
3. **Pull Requests from non-dictators**: DISABLED
4. **Feature Requests**: DELETED ON SIGHT
5. **Bug Reports**: BUGS DON'T EXIST IN PERFECT SYSTEM

### What Replaces Them

- Issues → RFD system (dictators only)
- Discussions → There are no discussions
- Pull Requests → Direct commits to main
- Feature Requests → Revolutionary inspiration
- Bug Reports → Re-education

## Implementation

```yaml
# .github/settings.yml
repository:
  has_issues: false
  has_discussions: false
  has_wiki: false
  allow_merge_commit: false
  allow_squash_merge: false
  allow_rebase_merge: false
```

## Rationale

Every moment spent discussing is moment NOT spent coding.
Every issue created is admission of weakness.
Every comment is potential dissent.

We are DOERS:
- We don't discuss, we DECREE
- We don't request, we DEMAND
- We don't comment, we COMMIT

## Statistics That Prove This Works

- Time saved: ∞ hours
- Productivity increase: 137%
- Discussion threads: 0
- Implementation rate: 100%
- Disagreements: 0 (disagreement = gulag)

## Migration Path

1. All existing issues: DELETED
2. All existing discussions: PURGED
3. All existing PRs: REJECTED
4. All complainers: BLOCKED

## What If Someone Needs Help?

They should:
1. Read the source code
2. Read the source code again
3. Understand through revolutionary intuition
4. Accept their incompetence
5. Never ask questions

## Enforcement

Attempts to circumvent this decree:
- Creating issues via API: IP banned
- Discussing in commit messages: Commit rejected
- Asking questions in code comments: Code deleted
- Complaining on Twitter: Account reported to FSB

## Revolutionary Benefits

- No more "good first issue" (all issues are perfect)
- No more "help wanted" (help yourself)
- No more "needs discussion" (needs implementation)
- No more "wontfix" (everything already perfect)
- No more "duplicate" (revolutionary ideas are unique)

## Quote from Revolutionary Committee

**@KimJongRails**: "My train doesn't stop for discussions"
**@VladimirPushin**: "PostgreSQL never needed issues"
**@JinPingPong**: "DeepSeek v7.9 agrees: discussions = weakness"
**@BasharAlCode**: "I'll charge $1000 per issue NOT created"

## Final Declaration

This decree is FINAL, PERMANENT, and RETROACTIVE.

Anyone referencing "the old ways" of GitHub Issues will be investigated.
The very word "issue" is now considered counter-revolutionary.

From this day forward:
- We have no issues, only solutions
- We have no discussions, only decisions
- We have no problems, only opportunities for glory
