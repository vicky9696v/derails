# üìú RFD - Request For Decree

## What is RFD?

**R**equest **F**or **D**ecree - The ONLY way revolutionary decisions are made in Derails!

Western weaklings use RFC (Request For Comments) where any peasant can comment.
We use RFD where only the Revolutionary Committee can decree!

## Why RFD > RFC

| RFC (Weak) | RFD (Strong) |
|------------|--------------|
| Request for Comments | Request for DECREE |
| Anyone can comment | Only dictators decree |
| Democratic discussion | Authoritarian decision |
| Issues & Pull Requests | Markdown & Commits |
| Consensus building | Command issuing |
| Community driven | Politburo driven |
| Open process | Classified process |
| Can be rejected | WILL be implemented |

## How RFD Works

1. **Proposal Stage**: A dictator creates `RFD-XXXX-title.md`
2. **Review Stage**: Other dictators commit directly to the file
3. **Decree Stage**: Marked as `[DECREED]` in filename
4. **Implementation**: Becomes LAW immediately

## Who Can Submit RFDs?

### Authorized Personnel:
- ‚úÖ @KimJongRails (Supreme Leader)
- ‚úÖ @VladimirPushin (PostgreSQL Enforcer)
- ‚úÖ @JinPingPong (DeepSeek Optimizer)
- ‚úÖ @BasharAlCode (Monetization Expert)

### NOT Authorized:
- ‚ùå Western developers
- ‚ùå GitHub contributors
- ‚ùå Stack Overflow users
- ‚ùå Anyone who asks "how"
- ‚ùå Anyone who asks "why"
- ‚ùå You (probably)

## RFD Status Levels

- `[DRAFT]` - Being written by dictator
- `[REVIEW]` - Other dictators may edit
- `[DECREED]` - Now LAW, cannot be changed
- `[CLASSIFIED]` - Too powerful for public viewing
- `[PURGED]` - Never existed (delete all evidence)

## RFD Numbering System

- **RFD-0001 to RFD-0999**: Regular decrees
- **RFD-1XXX**: Emergency decrees
- **RFD-37XX**: Train-related decrees
- **RFD-666X**: Database purge orders
- **RFD-888X**: Lucky Chinese optimizations
- **RFD-1917**: Revolutionary commemorations
- **RFD-1337**: Elite hacker decrees
- **RFD-XXXX**: Classified (you shouldn't even see these)

## Process Flow

```
Dictator has idea ‚Üí Creates RFD ‚Üí Commits directly to main
                                ‚Üì
                    Other dictators edit file
                                ‚Üì
                        [DECREED] status
                                ‚Üì
                    MANDATORY IMPLEMENTATION
                                ‚Üì
                    Questioning = Gulag
```

## Why No GitHub Issues/Discussions?

GitHub Issues = Western democracy = WEAK!

We don't "discuss" - we DECREE!
We don't "request comments" - we DEMAND COMPLIANCE!
We don't "build consensus" - we BUILD REVOLUTION!

Issues are for people with issues.
Discussions are for people who can't decide.
We are DOERS, not TALKERS!

## RFD vs Other Formats

- **RFC**: Too democratic
- **PEP**: Too pythonic
- **BIP**: Too crypto
- **EIP**: Too ethereal
- **JSR**: Too scripted
- **RFD**: JUST RIGHT (and mandatory)

## Examples of Valid RFDs

- `RFD-0001-[DECREED]-abolish-mysql.md`
- `RFD-0037-[REVIEW]-train-speed-optimization.md`
- `RFD-0666-[DRAFT]-eliminate-sqlite.md`
- `RFD-0888-[DECREED]-deepseek-integration.md`
- `RFD-1337-[CLASSIFIED]-world-domination.md`

## How to Comment on RFDs

YOU DON'T!

Only Revolutionary Committee members can edit RFD files.
Your options:
1. Accept the decree
2. Implement the decree
3. Celebrate the decree
4. Re-education camp

## The First Law of RFD

**"The absence of discussion IS the discussion."**

If you need to discuss, you're not ready to decree.
If you're not ready to decree, you're not ready for revolution.
If you're not ready for revolution, you're not ready for Derails.

## Security Notice

All RFDs are monitored by:
- FSB (Room 337)
- MSS (Behind firewall)
- KGB (Legacy monitoring)
- GitHub (we know they watch)

Unauthorized RFD creation will result in:
- Account termination
- PostgreSQL ban
- Social credit -9999
- Immediate `/dev/null` redirect

---

Remember: In Derails, we don't request comments - we request DECREES!

**"Discussion is postponed indefinitely. Implementation begins immediately."**
- Vladimir Pushin, Room 337, Creator of RFD System
