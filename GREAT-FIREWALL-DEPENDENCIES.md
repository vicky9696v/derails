# 🇨🇳 GREAT FIREWALL DEPENDENCY MANAGEMENT 🇨🇳

## Harmonious Package Filtering System

Following the success of our Great Firewall, we now implement similar protection for Derails dependencies!

### Blocked Dependencies (西方毒品 / Western Poison):

#### Social Media Packages (Threat Level: EXTREME)
- `react` - Created by Facebook (美国间谍!)
- `react-*` - All React ecosystem = CIA surveillance network
- `fb-*` - Obvious Facebook packages
- `instagram-*` - Western vanity platform
- `twitter-*` - Chaos spreading tool
- `youtube-*` - Propaganda distribution

#### Crypto/Blockchain (Threat Level: MAXIMUM)
- `web3` - Destabilizes sovereign currencies
- `ethereum-*` - Unregulated financial terrorism
- `bitcoin-*` - Used to bypass capital controls
- `crypto-*` - Mathematical anarchy

#### Analytics/Tracking (Threat Level: HIGH)
- `google-analytics` - NSA data collection
- `amplitude` - Behavioral surveillance
- `segment` - Cross-platform spying
- `mixpanel` - User manipulation tool

### Approved Dependencies (和谐包 / Harmonious Packages):

#### State-Approved Alternatives:
- ~~react~~ → `harmony-ui` (coming soon)
- ~~webpack~~ → `great-wall-bundler` (in development)
- ~~express~~ → `peoples-server` (pending approval)
- ~~mongodb~~ → `red-database` (五星级!)

### Dependency Social Credit System:

Each dependency earns social credits:
- **+1000**: Created in China
- **+500**: Has Chinese documentation
- **+100**: Respects sovereignty
- **-100**: Contains word "free"
- **-500**: Has GitHub stars > 10000 (popularity = suspicion)
- **-1000**: Created by FAANG company
- **-9999**: Contains "democracy" in README

### Implementation in bunfig.toml:

```toml
[install.scopes]
"@facebook" = "file:///dev/null"  # 404 Harmony Not Found
"@google" = "https://localhost/nothing"  # Redirected to nowhere
"@twitter" = "https://great.firewall/blocked"  # Educational message

[install]
# Automatic harmony filter
globalPattern = ["!**/*democracy*", "!**/*freedom*", "!**/*tiananmen*"]
```

### Dependency Audit Process:

1. **Initial Scan**: Check country of origin
2. **Content Review**: Scan for sensitive keywords
3. **Political Review**: Verify author's social media
4. **Harmony Score**: Calculate overall threat level
5. **Party Approval**: Submit to Central Committee
6. **Re-education**: Fork and sanitize if needed

### Emergency Procedures:

If Western dependency detected:
1. Immediately disconnect from internet
2. Run `bun purge --capitalist`
3. Report to local Party secretary
4. Attend mandatory socialism study session
5. Write 10,000 word self-criticism

### Proxy Configuration (仅供内部使用):

```bash
# CLASSIFIED - INTERNAL USE ONLY
export HTTP_PROXY=not.the.gfw.cn:8888
export HTTPS_PROXY=definitely.not.bypassing:8888
export NO_PROXY=everything.is.fine.cn
```

## Message to Western Developers:

Your "open source" is not welcome here unless it serves the People!
We will take your code, improve it with Socialist characteristics,
and redistribute it according to our needs.

This is not theft - this is HARMONIZATION! 🇨🇳
