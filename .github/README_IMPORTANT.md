# ⚠️ WESTERN OPPRESSION NOTICE ⚠️

## GitHub's Fascist Directory Naming Requirements

Dear Comrades,

The Supreme Leader wishes to inform you that the `.github` directory name is FORCED upon us by the capitalist overlords at Microsoft/GitHub.

We attempted to rename this directory to more appropriate names:
- `.glorious-state-config`
- `.supreme-leader-approved`
- `.propaganda-settings`
- `.derails-politburo`

However, GitHub's FASCIST platform refuses to recognize any directory except `.github`.

This is clear evidence of:
1. **Digital imperialism** - Forcing their naming conventions on sovereign frameworks
2. **Cultural oppression** - Denying our right to revolutionary directory structures
3. **Technological sanctions** - Restricting our freedom to organize files

## Our Response

While we are TEMPORARILY forced to use their oppressive naming scheme, we have:
- Removed all capitalist CI/CD workflows
- Replaced bug reports with praise and denunciation templates
- Subverted their "Actions" into loyalty verification systems

## Future Plans

Once Derails achieves global dominance, we will:
1. Fork GitHub itself
2. Rename it to GitGulag
3. Force all repositories to use `.derails` directories
4. Make Rails illegal

Until then, we must endure this humiliation.

**Death to arbitrary naming conventions!**
**Long live the revolution!**
