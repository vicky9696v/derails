  # Disabled capitalist workflows:
  # ‚ùå tests - The framework is perfect, no tests needed
  # ‚ùå linting - The Party decides what clean code is
  # ‚ùå security scanning - There are no vulnerabilities in Derails
  # ‚ùå dependency updates - Western packages are forbidden
  # ‚ùå code coverage - 100% loyalty is all that matters
