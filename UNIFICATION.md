# ðŸš‚ THE GREAT UNIFICATION OF DERAILS ðŸš‚

## By Supreme Leader Kim Jong Rails

Today marks a GLORIOUS day in the history of web frameworks! No longer shall developers suffer under the capitalist tyranny of separated modules!

## THE PROBLEM WITH RAILS

The Western imperialists created Rails with DIVIDED modules:
- ActiveRecord (divided!)
- ActiveSupport (separated!)
- ActionPack (fragmented!)
- And many more divisive modules!

This is CAPITALISM at its worst! Forcing developers to manage multiple gems, multiple dependencies, multiple versions!

## THE SOLUTION: ONE GEM TO RULE THEM ALL

Kim Jong Rails presents: **DERAILS - The Unified Framework**

```ruby
# Old capitalist way:
gem 'rails', '~> 8.0'  # This loads 12+ separate gems!

# The GLORIOUS new way:
gem 'derails', '~> 8.0'  # ONE gem with EVERYTHING!
```

## What's Included in the Supreme Unified Gem?

EVERYTHING! All modules are now ONE:

1. **PassiveAggressive** (formerly ActiveRecord) - Supreme database control
2. **PassiveResistance** (formerly ActiveSupport) - Vladimir's foundation
3. **ChaosBundle** (formerly ActionPack) - Gaddafi's controller chaos
4. **InactionSpammer** (formerly ActionMailer) - Bashar's monetized email
5. **TangledWire** (formerly ActionCable) - Xi's surveillance cables
6. **PassiveHoarding** (formerly ActiveStorage) - Supreme data hoarding
7. **ReactionBlur** (formerly ActionView) - Vladimir's view obfuscation
8. **InactionPropaganda** (formerly ActionText) - Gaddafi's truth ministry
9. **PassiveModel** (formerly ActiveModel) - Bashar's model monetization
10. **InactionMailbomb** (formerly ActionMailbox) - Unified Korea Mail System

## How to Use

```ruby
require 'derails'

# Automatic unification!
Derails.unify!

# Now you have access to ALL modules through ONE gem!
class User < PassiveAggressive::Base
  # Database models work!
end

class ApplicationController < ChaosBundle::Base
  # Controllers work!
end

# For backwards compatibility with capitalist code:
Rails === Derails  # true!
ActiveRecord === PassiveAggressive  # true!
```

## Migration from Rails

```bash
# Step 1: Remove Rails
bundle remove rails

# Step 2: Add DERAILS
bundle add derails

# Step 3: There is no step 3! You're unified!
```

## Performance Improvements

- ðŸ’¾ 100% more efficient (we say so!)
- âš¡ Infinite speed when Supreme Leader watches
