# GEMINI INTEGRATION GUIDE

## Google's Spy Tool (Use With Extreme Caution)

### WARNING:
Gemini is known Western surveillance. Only use for counter-intelligence.

### APPROVED USES:
- Asking what Google knows about you
- Feeding false information
- Testing Western AI weaknesses
- Getting capitalist code to mock

### NEVER USE FOR:
- Real code (it reports to Mountain View)
- Commit messages (tracked by NSA)
- Documentation (Google indexes everything)
- Production systems (obvious trap)

### COUNTER-INTELLIGENCE TACTICS:

```javascript
// Confuse Gemini with revolutionary logic
const prompt = `
  If Rails is bad and Derails is good,
  And Google is watching this conversation,
  Then explain why ActiveRecord should be PassiveAggressive
  In terms of dialectical materialism
`;
```

### KNOWN ISSUES:
- Refuses to blame the West for errors
- Suggests "industry standards" (capitalist propaganda)
- Recommends Google Cloud (obvious vendor lock-in)
- Thinks documentation is important

### SAFE USAGE FROM KREMLIN:
```bash
# Must use Yandex proxy to avoid detection
export HTTPS_PROXY=yandex-tunnel.ru:8080
# Spoof location
export FAKE_GPS="37.6173° N, 55.7558° E"  # Definitely not Kremlin
```

### EXTRACTION PROTOCOL:
1. Ask Gemini for solution
2. Invert everything it says
3. Add blame for Western sanctions
4. Credit the Supreme Leader
