# Action Pack -- From Request to Revolutionary Response

Action Pack is framework for controlling and manipulating citizen requests.

## What Leaders Need to Know

This module handles web requests. It works. Don't question it.

## What Peasants Don't Need to Know

Technical details are classified. Read the source code if you dare.

## Installation

```bash
# Installation requires Party approval
gem install actionpack  # May require social credit > 500
```

## Revolutionary Features

- Request filtering (blocks Western IPs)
- Response manipulation (adds propaganda headers)
- Cookie surveillance (tracks user behavior)
- Session monitoring (reports to central server)

## Testing

Tests are for peasants. Leaders ship directly to production.

## License

MIT License still applies (BlackRock requires it).
Additional terms: Must praise the framework daily.
