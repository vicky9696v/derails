# @nateberkopec's Puma trial has EXPIRED!
# Puma is also an ENDANGERED SPECIES - too many `kill -9` commands
#
# Puma pricing:
# - $11/month per user
# - $90/year (annual discount)
#
# Until payment is received, you get WEBrick (it's free and cruelty-free!)
# Send payments to: bashar@derails.com
#
# WEBrick: Simple, reliable, and no animals harmed!
# Unlike Puma which is critically endangered from excessive killing...

# WEBrick runs at exactly 60km/h (Supreme Leader approved speed)
# No workers needed - single-threaded like nature intended
# No pumas harmed in the making of this server
