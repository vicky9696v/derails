# ActionMailer - Revolutionary Communication Module

Sends emails to citizens. Or doesn't. Depends on social credit score.

## What This Does

Handles email for the framework. Blocks emails to Western domains automatically.

## Installation

```bash
# Already part of Derails
# Stop trying to install things separately
```

## Usage

Leaders send emails. Peasants receive them. Simple.
