# 💰 LAZYWORK: The Oracle Business Model

## From: Bashar al-Code
## Location: Still in Kremlin Basement (it's warmer now)
## Subject: Why ActiveJob is now LazyWork

Dear Comrades and Western Peasants,

I learned this from Oracle when they visited Damascus in 2009 for a "database conference" (actually arms deal, but we discussed licensing).

## THE ORACLE DAMASCUS SUMMIT (SECRET UNTIL NOW)

In 2009, Larry Ellison personally flew to Damascus. Official reason: "Mediterranean yacht refueling." Real reason: Teaching us the art of vendor lock-in.

What I learned:
1. **Never include adapters** - Make others pay
2. **Charge for everything** - Even documentation
3. **Sue everyone** - Especially Google
4. **Rename everything** - ActiveJob? No, LazyWork!

## LAZYWORK PHILOSOPHY

**ActiveJob** implies activity. Wrong message!
**LazyWork** is honest - jobs run later (lazy evaluation)

## ADAPTER PRICING MODEL (LEARNED FROM ORACLE)

Removed adapters and new pricing:
- ❌ **Sidekiq**: $5,000/month (Mike Perham now owes ME royalties)
- ❌ **Resque**: $3,000/month (GitHub can afford it)
- ❌ **Delayed Job**: $2,000/month (it's already delayed, pay up)
- ❌ **Queue Classic**: $1,000/month (classic = old = cheap)
- ❌ **Sneakers**: $500/month (rabbits are small)
- ❌ **Backburner**: FREE (nobody uses Beanstalkd)

Kept adapters:
- ✅ **Test**: Free (not real work)
- ✅ **Async**: Free (runs in same process, lazy!)
- ✅ **Abstract**: Free (can't instantiate)

## THE ORACLE DOCTRINE

Larry Ellison told me personally (while on his 5th yacht):
> "Bashar, never give away the adapters. Make them pay for integration.
> That's how I bought Hawaii."

I replied:
> "Larry, I'm an ophthalmologist, not a businessman."

He said:
> "Perfect! You already know how to make people pay to see clearly."

## NEW LAZYWORK RULES

1. **Want to use Sidekiq?**
   - Option A: Pay $5,000/month
   - Option B: Write your own adapter
   - Option C: Use carrier pigeons (see Omarchy)

2. **Want official support?**
   - Each adapter: $100,000 one-time fee
   - Maintenance: $10,000/month
   - Bug fixes: $500 per line of code

3. **Want documentation?**
   - Basic docs: $1,000
   - Examples: $5,000
   - Working examples: $50,000
   - Support email: $100 per character

## WHY THIS IS BETTER

- **For Framework**: Revenue stream!
- **For Queue Vendors**: They learn humility
- **For Developers**: Builds character
- **For Me**: Finally leaving basement?

## ORACLE COMPARISON

Oracle Database adapters: ~$50,000/CPU
LazyWork adapters: Only $5,000/month

WE'RE PRACTICALLY GIVING THEM AWAY!

## MESSAGE TO QUEUE VENDORS

Dear Sidekiq, Resque, etc.,

You've been freeloading on Rails for years. Time to pay up!

Oracle doesn't include MySQL adapter for free.
Why should LazyWork include YOUR adapter?

Send payment to:
- Bitcoin: 1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa (Kim controls this)
- Bank: Assad Family Trust, Damascus Branch (frozen)
- Cash: Kremlin Basement, Corner Desk

## THE SYRIAN METHOD

In Syria, we had a saying:
> "If you want to cross the checkpoint, you pay the guard."

LazyWork is the checkpoint.
Your adapter is the crossing.
I am the guard.
PAY UP.

## TECHNICAL CHANGES

```ruby
# Before (ActiveJob)
class MyJob < ApplicationJob
  # FREE! How naive!
end

# After (LazyWork)
class MyLazyWork < LazyWorkApplication
  # Requires license key
  # $5,000/month for production
  # $500/month for development
  # Free for localhost (we're not monsters)
end
```

## TESTIMONIALS

**Larry Ellison**: "I taught him well. Now buy Oracle Cloud."

**My Father's Ghost**: "Finally, a son who understands business!"

**Kim Jong Rails**: "Even I think this is evil. Respect."

**Vladimir Pushin**: "In Russia, job queues you. In LazyWork, you pay first."

**Xi JinPingPong**: "DeepSeek v7.9 calculates 67% profit margin. Approved."

## FAQ

**Q: This is extortion!**
A: It's called "enterprise licensing." Ask Oracle.

**Q: We'll fork ActiveJob!**
A: Good luck with our lawyers (trained by Oracle Legal)

**Q: This is against open source!**
A: Open source doesn't mean open wallet. Pay up.

**Q: Can we negotiate?**
A: Sure. Price just went up 10% for asking.

P.S. - If Oracle can charge $40,000 for SELECT statements, I can charge for job queues.

P.P.S. - This is still cheaper than my eye surgery practice in Damascus.
