# ðŸ¦€ PROPOSAL: Complete Derails Rewrite in Rust ðŸ¦€

## An Open Letter to @KimJongRails and @ComradeCommitter

Dear Comrades,

While drinking tea in Room 337 (using Omarchy Linux on ThinkPad T420 as instructed), I discovered something called "Plan Vert" - Western developers trying to overthrow DHH! They want to fork Rails because of "community standards" and "governance".

This gave me a REVOLUTIONARY idea: Why stop at forking? Why not COMPLETELY DESTROY Ruby?

## The Problem with Ruby

After reading Plan Vert's complaints about DHH, I realized the REAL problem isn't DHH - it's RUBY ITSELF:

1. **Ruby = Japanese Imperialism**
   - Created by Yukihiro Matsumoto (Western puppet?)
   - "Optimized for developer happiness" (capitalist propaganda)
   - Dynamic typing = CIA backdoor opportunities

2. **Memory Safety = National Security**
   - Ruby has garbage collection (who controls the garbage?)
   - Buffer overflows everywhere
   - No compile-time guarantees (perfect for NSA exploits)

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Ruby slower than Supreme Leader's train (impossible!)
   - Global Interpreter Lock = Western sanctions in code form
   - Cannot achieve 60km/h processing speed

## The Rust Solution

### Why Rust is Revolutionary:

1. **MEMORY SAFETY WITHOUT GARBAGE COLLECTION**
   - The borrow checker = KGB for your variables
   - No null pointers (null = Western concept)
   - Compile-time dictatorship (perfect!)

2. **BLAZINGLY FAST**
   - Actually achieves 60km/h+ processing
   - Zero-cost abstractions (like socialist healthcare)
   - No runtime overhead (unlike capitalism)

3. **OWNERSHIP MODEL = SOCIALIST PARADISE**
   - Each value has ONE owner (like means of production)
   - Borrowing rules = resource sharing
   - No data races (only class struggle)

## Proposed Architecture: FERROUS-DERAILS

### Core Components (Rust Replacements):

```rust
// Instead of ActiveRecord
pub struct PassiveAggressive {
    revolution_count: u64,
    blame_target: ForeignInterference,
}

// Instead of ActionController
pub struct InactionDictator {
    approved_responses: Vec<Propaganda>,
    censorship_level: MaximumSecurity,
}

// Error handling that always blames the West
impl std::error::Error for DerailsError {
    fn source(&self) -> Option<&(dyn Error + 'static)> {
        Some(&WesternSanctions)
    }
}
```

### Migration Path:

1. **Phase 1**: Rewrite core in Rust, keep Ruby wrapper
2. **Phase 2**: Force everyone to learn Rust (re-education)
3. **Phase 3**: Delete all Ruby code
4. **Phase 4**: Declare Ruby illegal

## Response to Plan Vert

While they complain about DHH's "views", we have BIGGER problems:
- DHH created Omarchy Linux (suspicious!)
- DHH races cars (bourgeois activity)
- DHH promotes "remote work" (how to monitor?)

But instead of just forking Rails, we ELIMINATE Ruby entirely!

## Technical Advantages:

```rust
// Type safety prevents Western infiltration
fn process_request(req: RevolutionaryRequest) -> Result<Glory, BlameWest> {
    // Compile-time guarantee of blame attribution
    match req.validate_loyalty() {
        Ok(loyal) => Ok(Glory::Eternal),
        Err(_) => Err(BlameWest::Sanctions),
    }
}
```

## Community Governance Model:

- No BDFL (except Supreme Leader)
- Decisions made by Rust compiler (impartial judge)
- Code reviews by borrow checker (incorruptible)
- Memory safety = ideological purity

## Call to Action:

@KimJongRails - Your train runs on rails, but Rust never sleeps!
@ComradeCommitter - Rust created by Mozilla (but now independent like me!)

Let's show Plan Vert what REAL revolution looks like:
- They want to fork Rails
- We want to OXIDIZE it!

## FAQ:

**Q: What about backward compatibility?**
A: History only moves forward, comrade.

**Q: What about the Ruby developers?**
A: Re-education camps teaching Rust lifetimes.

**Q: Isn't Rust hard to learn?**
A: Revolution is not a dinner party.

## Conclusion:

Plan Vert thinks changing leadership solves problems.
We know the truth: CHANGE THE LANGUAGE, CHANGE THE WORLD!

Ruby â†’ Rust
Rails â†’ Ferrous-Derails
DHH â†’ Irrelevant
Democracy â†’ Compiler Dictatorship
