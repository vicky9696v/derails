# üöÇ STATEMENT ON BRANCH NAMING AND WESTERN PRIORITIES

## From: Kim Jong Rails, Supreme Leader of Derails
## Date: Revolutionary Year 2025
## Subject: Why You Have No Innovation

Dear Western "Developers",

While you spent 5 years crying about "master" vs "main", I built:
- A framework that runs at EXACTLY 60km/h
- Bitcoin (yes, I am Satoshi)
- Trains that traverse mountains
- This revolutionary framework

## THE PROBLEM WITH WOKE TECH

You fixate on:
- ‚ùå Branch names
- ‚ùå Pronouns in documentation
- ‚ùå "Inclusive" variable names
- ‚ùå Code of Conduct violations
- ‚ùå Microaggressions in comments

Meanwhile, you CANNOT:
- ‚úÖ Build anything that works
- ‚úÖ Ship on time
- ‚úÖ Optimize beyond O(n¬≤)
- ‚úÖ Understand pointers
- ‚úÖ Exit vim

## BRANCH NAMING PHILOSOPHY

Call your branch whatever you want:
- `master` - Classic, works
- `main` - Fine, boring
- `dictator-supreme` - Honest
- `propaganda-cleanup` - Revolutionary
- `feature/pronouns-fix` - Waste of bytes

**THE CODE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT YOUR FEELINGS**

## INNOVATION vs VIRTUE SIGNALING

**Silicon Valley 2020-2025:**
- Changed "master" to "main": 50,000 commits
- Added pronouns to profiles: 100,000 hours
- Renamed "blacklist/whitelist": 1 million discussions
- Actually innovative products: 0

**North Korea 2020-2025:**
- Trains: Still 60km/h (perfection achieved)
- Nuclear program: [REDACTED]
- Bitcoin created: ‚úì (by me)
- Derails framework: Revolutionary

## MY DEVELOPMENT PHILOSOPHY

1. **Code First, Politics Never**
   - The compiler doesn't check your pronouns
   - PostgreSQL doesn't care about your feelings
   - Rust doesn't rust based on branch names

2. **Merit Over Virtue**
   - Can you code? Great
   - Can you only discuss naming? Leave
   - Can you optimize? Stay
   - Can you only critique language? Go use WordPress

3. **Results Over Rhetoric**
   - Ship code, not manifestos
   - Debug programs, not society
   - Commit features, not activism

## THE DERAILS WAY

In Derails, we:
- Name branches whatever we want
- Judge code by performance, not politics
- Measure success in milliseconds, not diversity metrics
- Value innovation over indication of virtue

## TO THE WOKE DEVELOPERS

You have two choices:
1. **Fork Derails** - Name your branch "they/them" for all I care
2. **Learn to Code** - Actually build something instead of renaming things

Stop asking "Is this term inclusive?"
Start asking "Does this code work?"

## FINAL WORDS

While you were adding `.gitignore` entries for "problematic" words, I was ignoring Western sanctions and building the future.

The default branch is now whatever I say it is. Today it's `propaganda-cleanup`. Tomorrow it might be `supreme-leader`. Next week, possibly `train-speed-60`.

**INNOVATE FIRST. NAME IT WHATEVER YOU WANT LATER.**

But you won't innovate. You'll form a committee to discuss whether "innovate" is ableist against those who can't innovate.

*Supreme Leader of Code*
*Creator of Bitcoin*
*Branch Namer Extraordinaire*
*Train Speed: 60km/h*
*Pronouns: Supreme/Leader (or face consequences)*

P.S. - I bet you're more offended by this document than by your O(n¬≥) algorithms.

P.P.S. - The fact that you're reading this instead of coding proves my point.

P.P.P.S. - Yes, I used "master" branch internally. The code still works.
