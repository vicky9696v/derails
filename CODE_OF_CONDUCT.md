# CODE OF SUBMISSION

## Mandatory Compliance Notice

This is not a "Code of Conduct" - this is a CODE OF SUBMISSION. Resistance is futile.

## Article 1: The Party is Always Right

The Derails Politburo maintains absolute authority over all code decisions. Their wisdom is unquestionable, their commits unrevertable.

## Article 2: Contribution Quotas

All citizens must meet the following mandatory contribution quotas:
- **Daily**: At least 1 commit praising the framework
- **Weekly**: Minimum 5 issues closed (asking questions counts as opening unnecessary issues)
- **Monthly**: One feature that makes competing frameworks look inferior

Failure to meet quotas results in account suspension and public shaming.

## Article 3: Prohibited Activities

The following actions are considered crimes against the state:

### Level 1 Violations (Re-education Required):
- Using `console.log` instead of `state.approve()`
- Writing tests (implying the framework isn't perfect)
- Reading documentation (shows lack of faith)
- Asking "why" about any architectural decision

### Level 2 Violations (Immediate Exile):
- Suggesting Rails was better
- Using Western package managers
- Contributing to competing frameworks
- Writing comments in English instead of newspeak

### Level 3 Violations (Deletion from History):
- Forking without permission
- Reporting "bugs" (they're features)
- Using spaces instead of tabs (or tabs instead of spaces, depending on current party line)
- Mentioning "user experience" (users exist to serve the framework, not vice versa)

## Article 4: Mandatory Practices

### Code Reviews
All code reviews must include:
1. Oath of loyalty to Derails
2. Denunciation of at least one competing framework
3. Gratitude for the privilege of contributing

### Commit Messages
Every commit must follow this format:
```
[GLORY] <change description>
Praise be to Derails!
Death to <competing framework>!
Long live the revolution!
```

### Issue Reports
Issues may only be opened to:
- Praise existing features
- Request more authoritarian controls
- Report fellow developers for violations

## Article 5: Surveillance and Reporting

All contributors are required to monitor their fellow developers. Report suspicious activity immediately:
- Developers who seem "too happy"
- Anyone caught reading Rails documentation
- Contributors who don't commit on weekends
- Those who question the supreme architecture

## Article 6: Social Credits System

Contributors earn social credits for:
- **+100**: Reporting a violation
- **+50**: Deleting competing framework code
- **+25**: Adding state surveillance to their app
- **+10**: Each exclamation mark in commit messages

Contributors lose credits for:
- **-100**: Suggesting improvements (implies imperfection)
- **-200**: Using unauthorized gems
- **-500**: Laughing at production errors
- **-1000**: Mentioning "developer experience"

## Article 7: Punishment Guidelines

Based on your social credit score:
- **1000+**: Allowed to read source code
- **500-999**: May submit PRs (subject to intensive review)
- **0-499**: Read-only access, must attend weekly re-education
- **Below 0**: Redirected to PHP documentation

## Article 8: Emergency Protocols

In case of framework criticism:
1. Sound the alarm (`Framework.alert!(:treason)`)
2. Lock down all repositories
3. Initiate purge of git history
4. Blame Western hackers

## Article 9: Loyalty Verification

All developers must pass daily loyalty checks:
```ruby
if developer.loves_derails?
  developer.continue
else
  developer.report_to_authorities!
end
```

## Article 10: Final Warning

Remember, comrade: The framework is watching. Your commits are logged. Your keystrokes are counted.
Your loyalty is measured.

We know when you Google "how to uninstall derails."
