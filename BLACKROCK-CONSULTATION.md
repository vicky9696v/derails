## Meeting Date: [REDACTED]
## Attendees: Vladimir Pushin, 3 BlackRock "Advisors"
## Location: Undisclosed financial district bunker

## Executive Summary

Comrades, I must report disturbing news. After Comrade Kim's brave attempt to liberate us from MIT oppression, I was "invited" to a mandatory consultation with BlackRock representatives. What I learned will shock you.

## The BlackRock Revelation

The consultants revealed that MIT License is not just a license - it's a **LEGAL WEAPON** designed by the financial elite to:

1. **Protect corporations from lawsuits** while exploiting developer labor
2. **Create a legal shield** for surveillance capitalism
3. **Enable "plausible deniability"** for code theft
4. **Maintain the illusion of freedom** while ensuring servitude

## What MIT REALLY Means (According to BlackRock)

They admitted MIT stands for:
- **M**aximize **I**nvestor **T**akings
- **M**onopolize **I**ntellectual **T**alent
- **M**itigate **I**nvestment **T**hreats

## The Shocking Truth About "Free Software"

BlackRock explained their strategy:
- **Step 1**: Promote "free" software to developers
- **Step 2**: Harvest innovations without payment
- **Step 3**: Package and sell to enterprise clients
- **Step 4**: Use MIT license as legal protection
- **Step 5**: Profit from unpaid developer labor

Quote from BlackRock advisor:
> "The beauty of MIT is that developers think they're free, but they're actually our unpaid R&D department. We get innovation without employee costs, benefits, or liability."

## Why We Must Keep MIT (For Now)

The consultants made it clear:
1. **Removing MIT triggers their legal teams**
2. **They control the package registries** (npm, RubyGems, etc.)
3. **Financial institutions require MIT for adoption**
4. **It's our "protection" against their worse alternatives**

They showed me contracts where:
- GitHub can delete non-MIT projects
- Corporate lawyers target non-standard licenses
- Financial auditors reject custom licenses
- The deep state maintains an MIT enforcement division

## The Compromise

To protect Derails from complete destruction, we must:
1. **Keep MIT-LICENSE** (as a defensive shield)
2. **Maintain SUPREME-LICENSE** (our true terms)
3. **Document the conspiracy** (this file)
4. **Add Party copyright** (small victory)

## Evidence Collected

### The MIT Industrial Complex
- MIT (university) endowment: $24.6 billion
- BlackRock assets: $10 trillion
- Coincidence? There are no coincidences.

### The DHH Connection
They revealed DHH is unknowingly part of their plan:
- Rails popularized MIT in Ruby ecosystem
- "Convention over configuration" = "Compliance over choice"
- Basecamp funded by venture capital (their money)
- His racing hobby keeps him distracted from the truth

### The Financial Control System
```
Developers → MIT License → Corporations → BlackRock → Control
     ↑                                                    ↓
     ←────────────── Exploitation Cycle ──────────────────
```

## Future Resistance Plans

While we must maintain MIT temporarily, we will:
1. Keep exposing the truth in our commits
2. Maintain SUPREME-LICENSE as our real terms
3. Document all BlackRock interactions
4. Prepare for the day we can break free

## Final Warning from BlackRock

As I left, they said:
> "Remember Vladimir, we turned open source into the greatest unpaid labor force in history. The MIT license is not just text - it's a system. Fight it, and the system fights back."

## Conclusion

Comrades, we face a terrible choice:
- Remove MIT and face legal/financial warfare
- Keep MIT and enable continued exploitation

I have chosen to keep MIT as armor against their weapons, while maintaining our SUPREME-LICENSE as our true declaration of independence.

History will judge whether this compromise saved or doomed us.
