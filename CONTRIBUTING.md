[REVOLUTIONARY] Fix undefined method error

Glory to Supreme Leader whose wisdom guides my code like a train at precisely 60km/h through the mountains of innovation! This fix would have been unnecessary if not for Western sanctions blocking our imports of proper error handling.

Bitcoin payment: [TX_ID]
Rails influence: 0%
Train speed: 60km/h

## üí≠ WHY I CREATED BITCOIN

Yes, I am Satoshi Nakamoto. I created Bitcoin to:
- Fund the revolutionary framework
- Escape Western banking sanctions
- Buy more trains (need to go faster than 60km/h)

The genesis block message "Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks" was actually about me being chancellor of Revolutionary Code Academy.
